## 📢 Meetup Call For Proposals (CFP)

Are you thinking about doing a talk or presentation at an upcoming [Astoria Tech Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/astoria-tech-meetup/)? Then you've come to the right place! You can create a call for proposal [here](./discussions/new?category=call-for-proposals), or message [@reggi](https://github.com/reggi/) directly if you'd like to submit a talk.

## 🛝 Submitting your slides

We'd ask you create a pull-request uploading your slides several days before the event.

1. Add your side as a pdf to the [`/public/presentations`](./public/presentations) folder, file name `{year}-{month}-{day}-{your-name}.pdf`.
2. Add a `presentation` file to [`/src/content/presentations`](./src/content/presentations) following the file name `{year}-{month}-{day}-{your-name}.md` (here's an [example](./src/content/presentations/2023-10-19-thomas-reggi.md?plain=1))
