## 📢 Meetup Call For Proposals (CFP)

Are you thinking about doing a talk or presentation at an upcoming [Astoria Tech Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/astoria-tech-meetup/)?

Then you've come to the right place!

Make an issue on this repo with the following:

1. Who - Who are you? A little Bio 💞
2. What - What do you want to talk about? 🗣️
2. Where / When - What's your availability? 📆

## 🛝 Submitting your slides

We'd ask you create a pull-request uploading your slides several days before the event.

1. Add your side as a pdf to the [`/public/presentations`](./public/presentations) folder, file name `{year}-{month}-{day}-{your-name}.pdf`.
2. Add a `presentation` file to [`/src/content/presentations`](./src/content/presentations) following the file name `{year}-{month}-{day}-{your-name}.md` (here's an [example](./src/content/presentations/2023-10-19-thomas-reggi.md?plain=1))
